# Time Series Analysis Project: Air Quality Index (AQI)

## Overview

Time series analysis involves the use of statistical techniques to analyze and model data points collected at successive intervals. This approach helps in identifying patterns and trends within the data over time, enabling informed decision-making. In this project, we will explore a time-series analysis focusing on data related to the Air Quality Index (AQI).

The AQI data is collected over various periods, providing key insights into the air quality of a particular region. The AQI scale ranges from 0 to 500, where higher numbers indicate worse air pollution. Monitoring AQI data over time is essential for recognizing patterns and trends in air quality, which can inform strategies to improve environmental conditions.

## Data Decomposition

Data decomposition is a technique used to separate a time series into its fundamental components. This approach helps to clarify the underlying patterns within the data. The AQI data can be divided into four main components: trend, seasonality, cyclic, and residual.

- **Trend Component**: This represents the long-term direction in the data, either upward or downward. In AQI data, a positive trend may indicate worsening air quality, while a negative trend suggests improvements.
  
- **Seasonality**: This involves regular and predictable patterns that repeat over a specific period, such as a year or a quarter. For AQI data, higher levels may be observed during hotter months when increased temperatures lead to more pollution.
  
- **Cyclic Component**: This captures changes occurring over longer periods, such as several months. In AQI data, a cyclic pattern might show improved air quality during cooler months when pollution levels tend to be lower.
  
- **Residual**: This component includes random variations in the data that cannot be explained by other components.

## Data Visualization

Visualizing time-series data is crucial for understanding trends and patterns. Tools like line plots, histograms, and box plots are effective for depicting AQI data. For instance, a line graph can display AQI changes over time, while a histogram can illustrate the distribution of AQI values.

## Seasonal Overview

Seasonal patterns are recurring trends observed over specific intervals, such as annually or quarterly. In AQI data, pollution levels might be higher during warm months due to increased temperatures. To analyze seasonality in AQI data, tools like seasonality graphs and Seasonal-Trend decomposition using Loess (STL) can be utilized. These tools help isolate the seasonal component, enhancing our understanding of underlying patterns.

## Predictive and Forecasting Models

After examining AQI data to identify trends and patterns, predictive and forecasting models can be used to anticipate future air quality. Various models are available for time series forecasting, including ARIMA, Prophet, and ETS.

- **ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)**: This popular model combines past data values with error terms to make predictions.
  
- **Prophet**: Developed by Facebook, this model uses a blend of regression and temporal components for forecasting. It is versatile and can handle missing data and outliers, making it suitable for AQI analysis.
  
- **ETS (Error, Trend, Seasonality)**: This method uses exponential smoothing with regression for forecasting.

Using these models, we can forecast future AQI values and assess how different factors, like weather conditions, affect air quality. This information supports air quality management and helps implement measures to improve environmental conditions.

## Conclusion

Time series analysis provides valuable insights into trends and patterns related to air quality. By decomposing data, visualizing trends, and using predictive models, we can make informed decisions to enhance air quality management. The AQI time series analysis project exemplifies the practical application and versatility of time series analysis in addressing real-world challenges.
