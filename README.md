# Time Series Analysis for Air Quality Index (AQI)
 Time series analysis involves the use of statistical techniques to analyze and model data points collected at successive intervals. This approach helps in identifying patterns and trends within the data over time, enabling informed decision-making. In this project, we will explore a time-series analysis focusing on data related to the Air Quality Index (AQI).  The AQI data is collected over various periods, providing key insights into the air quality of a particular region. The AQI scale ranges from 0 to 500, where higher numbers indicate worse air pollution. Monitoring AQI data over time is essential for recognizing patterns and trends in air quality, which can inform strategies to improve environmental conditions.
